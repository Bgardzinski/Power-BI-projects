# Power BI projects
Two Power BI projects: **Populations** and **Cellural Data usage**

# 1. Populations Dashboard

  An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing global population trends, income distribution, and demographic insights across different world regions.
  **Data collected and combined form multiple different sources.**

  **Overview**

This project presents an analytical overview of global population data, focusing on:

- Urban vs. rural population distribution

- Age demographics (senior vs. non-senior populations)

- Income group segmentation

- Year-over-year (YoY) population growth

- Regional and country-level growth comparisons

The dashboard provides a clear, dynamic, and data-driven view of how populations evolve over time and differ between regions.

**Key Insights Displayed**
1. Population Composition

- Rural vs. Urban Population (%): Displays global urbanization trends.

- Senior (65+) vs. Non-Senior Population (%): Highlights aging trends across regions.

- Lower-income vs. Higher-income Population (%): Shows global economic stratification.

2. Total Population Growth

    A line chart tracks the total global population by year, illustrating steady growth trends.

3. Regional Distribution

    A line chart compares the percentage of total population by region, showing which regions are growing faster or slower over time.

4. Income Groups

    A donut chart visualizes the distribution of world population by income group, making it easy to compare shares between low, middle, and high-income countries.

5. Year-over-Year Growth

    A stacked bar chart shows YoY percentage change in population by region, revealing patterns of acceleration or slowdown in population growth.

6. Top Country Growth

    A ranked table lists countries with the highest total population growth (2006–2025) — highlighting examples like Qatar, Niger, and the UAE.

# 2. Cellural Data Dashboard

  An interactive **2 page** Power BI dashboard visualizing global cellular data usage, revenue, and penetration trends across regions and service types.
  **Data collected and combined form multiple different sources.**

 **Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive analytical view of the cellular communications market, highlighting global and regional performance across multiple dimensions:

- Total revenue, subscriptions, and population coverage

- Revenue/penetration relative to global averages

- Connection types (3G, 4G, 5G, smartphones, and others)

-  Revenue by service type (Mobile Data, Voice, SMS, Non-SMS)

- Year-over-year (YoY) growth and regional trends over time

- The dashboard enables users to explore both current cellular market performance and its evolution over time.
