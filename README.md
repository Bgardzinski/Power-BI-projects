# Power BI projects
Two Power BI projects: **Populations** and **Cellural Data usage**

1. Populations Dashboard

  An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing global population trends, income distribution, and demographic insights across different world regions.

  **Overview**

This project presents an analytical overview of global population data, focusing on:

- Urban vs. rural population distribution

- Age demographics (senior vs. non-senior populations)

- Income group segmentation

- Year-over-year (YoY) population growth

- Regional and country-level growth comparisons

The dashboard provides a clear, dynamic, and data-driven view of how populations evolve over time and differ between regions.

2. Cellural Data Project

  Project answering questions about change of usage of particular cellural services - along with penetrations ratios.
  Project contains data that should represent same thing - but gathered from two different sources. (Ovum and WCIS)
  Multiple excel sheets compiled by Power Query ETL process.
